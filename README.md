# Django-search-API-using-Elastic-Search
An optimal search engine gives desired results according to the search content provided. 
Here is the Django rest API, which uses Elastic-search to provide optimum search results. 
This API was developed as a part of my project as a data science intern at yatra.com for their internal faq(data to resolve internal queries). 
To use this Hands-on experience in writing Elastic search queries. Also, an experience in developing Django rest API is helpful. Intermediate knowledge of NLP is a plus point.
I also wrote a python ETL(extract load and transfer) script to index the data to elastic search from the SQL database (it was monet-db in my case). Kibana can be used to visualize elastic search data.
